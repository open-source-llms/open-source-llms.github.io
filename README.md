# LLM Openness Taxonomy

There are several components involved in the training, evaluation and deployment pipeline to obtain a Large Language Model (LLM). Model developers decide whether to make each component of those pipelines private or public, with varying levels of restrictions for the latter.

ðŸŽ¯ The main aim of this taxonomy is to provide a structured way to track the openness of the pipelines involved in training, evaluating and deploying LLMs today. As discussed in detail in our paper [*Risks and Opportunities of Open-Source Generative AI*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.08597), the openness of the components involved in training, evaluation and deployment has key implications in terms of transparency, reproducibility and safety of these models.

The current taxonomy is available at [https://open-source-llms.github.io](https://open-source-llms.github.io).

### Contributing

ðŸ«¶ We need your help to keep this taxonomy up to date!

Each of the models in the taxonomy is described in a `.md` file within the `_llms` folder. To add a new model, simply add a new file by filling in the classification of each component, and submit a pull request to the main branch.
