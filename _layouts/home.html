  <!-- <h4>Introduction</h4> -->
  <div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
    Applications of Generative AI (GenAI) are expected to revolutionize a number of different areas, ranging from science & medicine to education. The potential for these seismic changes has triggered a lively debate about the potential risks of the technology, and resulted in calls for tighter regulation, in particular from some of the major tech companies who are leading in AI development. This regulation is likely to put at risk the budding field of open-source generative AI. Using a three-stage framework for GenAI development (near, mid and long-term), we analyze the risks and opportunities of open-source generative AI models with similar capabilities to the ones currently available (near to mid-term) and with greater capabilities (long-term). We argue that, overall, the benefits of open-source GenAI outweigh its risks. As such, we encourage the open sourcing of models, training and evaluation data, and provide a set of recommendations and best practices for managing risks associated with open-source generative AI.

  <h4>Our Openness Taxonomy</h4>
  <img src="/assets/images/components.png" alt="Openness Taxonomy" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; display: block;">
  <br>
  <div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: medium">Pipeline of the components of model (1) training, (2) evaluation and (3) deployment for typical LLMs.</div>
  <br>

  There are several components involved in the training, evaluation and deployment pipeline to obtain a Large Language Model (LLM).
  Model developers decide whether to make each component of those pipelines <div style="font-style: italic; display: inline;">private</div> or <div style="font-style: italic; display: inline;">public</div>, with varying levels of restrictions for
  the latter.
  <br><br>
  <div style="font-weight: bold; display: inline;">ðŸŽ¯ The main aim of this taxonomy is to provide a structured way to track the openness of the pipelines involved in training, evaluating and deploying LLMs today.</div>
  As discussed in detail in our paper, the openness of the components involved in training, evaluation and deployment has key implications in terms of transparency, reproducibility and safety of these models.
